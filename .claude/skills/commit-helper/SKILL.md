# Commit Helper

## Workflow

1. Inspect staged changes:
   - `git status`
   - `git diff --cached`
2. Draft a conventional commit message.
3. Confirm with the user before committing.
4. Commit using the approved message.

## Commit Prefixes

- `feat:` new feature
- `fix:` bug fix
- `chore:` maintenance/refactor
- `docs:` documentation update

Prefer short, specific commit messages that explain why the change exists.

## Pre-Commit Checks

Before committing, run:
```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm build
```

## Rules

- Do NOT include "Made-with: Cursor", "Made with Cursor", "Made with Claude", or any AI attribution in commit messages or trailers.
